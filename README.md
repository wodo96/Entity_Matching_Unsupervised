# Using Entity Matching Unsupervised

1- Run the script Run.sh as:
    
    sh ./Run.sh (DATASET_NAME) (NÂ°BLOCKS)

Number of blocks is not required (setted by default at 20)

2- If you want to store Output in a file and put the two trains files generated from this system run the script Run_and_save.sh as:
    
    sh ./Run_and_save.sh (DATASET_NAME)

it will store the output in a folder.

3- If you just want to store the two trains files generated from this system (train.csv and (dataset_name)_output-unsupervised.csv) run the script Store_train_data.sh as:

    sh ./Store_train_data.sh (DATASET_NAME)
